      "abstract": "This randomized controlled trial examined the efficacy of ACE inhibitors versus other antihypertensive medications in 2,500 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. Results showed a 23% reduction in cardiovascular events with ACE inhibitor therapy compared to calcium channel blockers. The study followed patients for 5 years with primary endpoints including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death.",

      "abstract": "We developed and validated a machine learning algorithm using electronic health record data to predict sepsis onset 6 hours before conventional clinical criteria. The algorithm analyzed vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical notes from 50,000 ICU admissions across 12 hospitals. The model achieved an AUROC of 0.91 with 85% sensitivity and 87% specificity.",
